# ir_volume_control

- I'm controlling an audio amp with an Apple remote, and I wanted to make a rotary volume to complement the Apple remote.

– Simple solution by connecting rotary encoder and IR transmission module.
– Reading the rotation direction from the rotary encoder and sending the signal to the IR transmitting module.
– I tried to merge the code published on github (the old code did not work as the library was updated)
– I checked the Apple remote control transmission code (I installed the IR receiving module first and read the button value)


The signal values of Apple's remote control are as follows.

Left button: 77E190BF.
Right button: 77E160BF.
Upper button: 77E150BF.
Down button: 77E130BF.
Middle button: 77E13ABF.
Menu button: 77E1C0BF.
Play button: 77E1FABF.
